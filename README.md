# real-estate-starter
This project is a real estate listing website built with React. It provides a platform for users to browse through various property listings and view detailed information about each property.

## Project Structure
The project is structured into various components and pages, each serving a specific purpose:

- `src/data.js`: This file contains data for a real estate listing website. It defines an array called housesData which contains object literals representing each listing.

- `src/pages/PropertyDetails.js`: This file defines a React component named PropertyDetails. It renders a div with the text "PropertyDetails".

- `src/index.js`: This file initializes the root ReactDOM element and renders the app within the Router and HouseContextProvider components.

- `src/App.js`: This file defines the main App component. It imports and renders reusable Header and Footer. It also defines routes and maps them to page components (Home and PropertyDetails).

- `src/pages/Home.js`: This file is a React component that represents the home page of the app. It renders the Banner, Search, and HouseList components.

- `src/components/Search.js`: This file contains the Search component which renders the search form for finding houses.

- `src/components/House.js`: This file defines a House component that renders information about a house property.

- `public/index.html`: This file serves as the entry point for the React app. It provides the basic HTML structure and includes resources needed for the React app.

- `package.json`: This file contains all the metadata needed to describe an npm package and manage its dependencies.

- `package-lock.json`: This file is automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the node_modules tree, or package.json.
